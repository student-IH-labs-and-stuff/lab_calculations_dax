# Lab | Calculations and DAX

Use the data source AdventureWorks_Database.xlsx]() in the ``Files for lab`` folder for this lab- you can continue with the PowerBI workbook created in the previous lab

### Instructions 
The goal of this lab is to answer a specific business scenario using the data source(s) provided - applying some logical thinking about how to approach the problem based on the techniques you have already mastered in PowerBI. You might need to refer back to the documentation to find the best DAX formula or Power Query method to approach the problem. Attempt to answer as many questions as you can but dont feel pressured to cover every requirement of this business scenario. Save your workbook with any related data modelling solutions, formulae and plots. If you have time you can try the optional challenge below to create a more polished one page report. 

## Scenario 
The owner of the AdventureWorks cycle store wants to understand more about the purchasing potential of customers with children, so you will want to filter out from your reports any customers who dont have any children. For this reason they have conducted a survey and collected as much accurate information as possible about their customers family sizes. The store wants to focus on the most recent 3 years of sales in the database, and to separate customers into small families(1-3 children) and large families (3+ children). Here are some specific questions: 
- Whats the average annual spend per child- by each adventureworks customer in the two types of families?
- Is there true that large families with most of the children at home spend more throughout the year than in the direct run up to christmas? 
- What are the most popular 5-10 products for large and small families? Are these top products the same in both cases? Does it vary based on the % of children living at home that each customer has?
- How does this vary between the different countries in the database? Of course we have more customers in the US but are relatively more customers with large families in the US making most of their Adventureworks purchases at a particular time of year than large families in Europe and Australia? 


### Optional 
Present your findings and insight based around this business scenario in a single comparative report page (multiple visuals) which has been designed with interactivity and visual best practices for data visualisation in mind. Keep the view uncluttered as much as possible and consider the appropriate chart types, use of pre attentive attributes and the best ways to communicate those insights.
